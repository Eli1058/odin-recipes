                This carrot cake recipe with a homemade cream cheese frosting is my favorite, 
                and I have tried many carrot cakes! It's moist, easy to make with grated carrots, and so delicious!

                "This recipe is fabulous," according to Joyce. "I made it exactly as written and it has been a favorite
                of my family for years. I even make it for my vegan granddaughter by using an egg substitute."
